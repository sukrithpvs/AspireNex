# Image Captioning with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to train an image captioning model using PyTorch. The model combines a pre-trained ResNet for image encoding and a pre-trained GPT-2 language model for caption generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Transformers
- Pandas
- Pillow
- Gradio (optional)


## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Set the paths for the `images_folder` and `captions_file` variables in the code.
   - Ensure the dataset is structured as mentioned above.

2. **Train the model**:
   - Run the code to start the training process.
   - The model will be trained for 25 epochs, and the training and validation losses will be displayed after each epoch.
   - The trained model will be saved as `image_captioning_model.pth`.

3. **Generate captions**:
   - The code includes a `generate_caption_for_image` function that takes an image path and generates a caption using the trained model.
   - You can call this function with an image path to generate a caption for a specific image.

4. **(Optional) Create a Gradio interface**:
   - If you have Gradio installed, you can create an interactive interface to generate captions for uploaded images.
   - Uncomment the `main` function and run the code to launch the Gradio interface.
   - Upload an image, and the generated caption will be displayed.

## Model Architecture

The image captioning model consists of two main components:

1. **ResNet**: A pre-trained ResNet model is used for image encoding. The last fully connected layer and average pooling layer are removed, and the output features are projected to match the size of the GPT-2 hidden state.

2. **GPT-2**: A pre-trained GPT-2 language model is used for caption generation. The image features are added to the input embeddings of the GPT-2 model to incorporate visual information during caption generation.

The combined model is trained end-to-end using the PyTorch framework.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the image captioning tutorial from the PyTorch documentation and the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Sure, here's a `README.md` file that explains how to set up and run the provided face recognition system using the ArcFace model.

# Face Recognition System using ArcFace

This repository contains code for a face recognition system using an ArcFace model with additional features such as facial expression recognition, gender detection, and accuracy measurement.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy
```


### 1. Download the Pre-trained Model

Download the ArcFace model weights (`backbone_r100.pth`) and place it in the desired directory. You can find the pre-trained model weights [here](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/arcface-face-recognition.git
cd arcface-face-recognition
```

### 3. Place the Haarcascade XML File

Download the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file from the OpenCV GitHub repository and place it in the desired directory. You can find it [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).


## Code Explanation

### Model Definition

The `YourArcFaceModel` class defines a simple neural network for face recognition based on ArcFace. The model is initialized with a convolutional layer, pooling layer, and a fully connected layer.

### Loading Pre-trained Weights

The pre-trained weights are loaded into the model using `torch.load` and `model.load_state_dict`.

### Face Detection

Faces are detected in the video stream using OpenCV's `CascadeClassifier`.

### Extracting Face Embeddings

The function `extract_face_embedding` preprocesses the face image and extracts embeddings using the ArcFace model.

### Calculating Accuracy

The function `calculate_accuracy` calculates the accuracy based on the predicted labels and true labels. This is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual logic for calculating accuracy.

### Live Video Processing

The `process_live_video` function captures live video from the webcam, detects faces, extracts embeddings, and displays the bounding box and accuracy on the video feed.

## Usage

1. Ensure your webcam is connected and working.
2. Run the `face_recognition.py` script.
3. The system will display the live video feed with detected faces and calculated accuracy.
4. Press 'q' to quit the video feed.

## Troubleshooting

- If the video feed does not open, ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible.
- If faces are not detected, make sure the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is in the correct path.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Side:**
   - Select 'X' or 'O' and click "Start Game".

2. **Choose Who Goes First:**
   - Decide if you want to start first or let the computer go first.

3. **Make Your Move:**
   - Click on an empty cell to place your mark.
   - The computer will make its move automatically.

4. **Reset the Game:**
   - Click "Reset" to start a new game.
